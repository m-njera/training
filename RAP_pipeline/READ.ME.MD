####Docker Compose Setup for Mage-AI, PostgreSQL, PgAdmin,Grafana, and Jupyter####

This README will guide you through the step-by-step processof running the Docker Compose setup for the Mage-AI, PostgreSQL, PgAdmin,Grafana, and Jupyter services. The instructions will explain how to configurebindings, PostgreSQL credentials, and other required edits.

**Requirements**

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Docker**: The Docker platform must be installed on your system.
    

*   **Docker Compose**: Docker Compose should be installed as well.
    

You can verify the installation by running the followingcommands in your terminal:
```bash
docker --version
```
```bash
docker-compose --version
```
####Step 1: Clone or Download the Project Files####
-------------------------------------------

First, ensure you have the docker-compose.yml file ready on your machine. You can create this file manually or download it from the repository.

####Step 2: Set Up Bind Volumes####
---------------------------

### Explanation of Bind Volumes:

In this Docker Compose setup, **bind mounts** are used to map directories on your local machine to directories inside the containers. This allows changes to files in the local directory to be reflected inside the container and vice versa.

```bash
volumes:
  - type: bind
    source: C:\Users\user\Documents\COMESA
    target: /home/src/default_repo/rap
```
In this example:

*   **source** is the path to a local directory on your machine (C:\\Users\\user\\Documents\\COMESA).
    
*   **target** is the path inside the container (/home/src/default\_repo/rap).
    

### Edit the Bind Source Directory:

The source path points to the directory where your local files are stored. You must ensure this path exists on your machine before running the containers. If you are using a different directory, replace C:\\Users\\user\\Documents\\COMESA with your preferred path.

#### Example:

If your directory is C:\\Projects\\MageAI, update the volumes section as follows:
